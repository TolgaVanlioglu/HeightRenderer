# HeightRenderer
 
A simple tech demo that takes a black and white image, and uses the value of its pixels to render them as 3d. It also calculates basic shadows using the height values.

(voxga.yyp is used to open the project in Gamemaker Studio 2, and HeightRenderer.zip has the compiled .exe)

Use right/left arrow keys to rotate the model, up/down arrows to change the model's height, and WASD and Q/E to move the camera and zoom in/out.
